# My Code

- All the tests seem to pass. I am not sure on what I am supposed to explain for code changes. I took Matthew's MarkdownParse code, as it was the most updated, and it just worked. I would say that all the tests work as we made a lot of test cases that produced errors, and fixed them.

 - for snippet 1, I do think that there could be a small code change that would fix it. The code should keep in mind where the backticks are, and if it is outside the link markdown line (or whatever it is called), it should disregard that line.
 - for snippet 2, I think that we could make a small code change. I think that we could pair up the brackets and the parenthesis, so that it checks whether the link is correct or not.
 - for snippet 3, I do think that there could be a small code change that could fix it. The code just needs to keep in mind where the newlines are.
