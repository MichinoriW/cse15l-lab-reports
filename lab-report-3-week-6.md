# Streamlining ssh Configuration
![First error](sshConfigError.png)
- Unfortunately, I am unable to log into the ssh server. As such, I am unable to complete this task. 

# Setup Github Access from ieng6
![Second Error](githubServerError.png)
- Unfortunately, I also seem to have an error here. I can't seem to be able to use the 'git" commands with the server. If I don't use the server, then I am able to commit and push using the command line, (though for some reason, the terminal does not show where I put the command).

# Copy whole directories with `scp -r`
![Third Error](scpServerError.png)
- I have a similar problem with that of the first part of the lab. I am  unable to log into the ssh server.
